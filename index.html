						will that
						I may be transformed and revived.Indeed
						God was with us.His message for us was so precise and specific. I was
						and still
						convinced that what we have learnt comes

					<p>"The camp was amazing ...I'm realising all the knowledge iv gained.
						Studying the different chapters with everyone in groups made it
						interesting...The teachings from the different speakers
						are lessons we must treasure forever -very relevant to our time .

						The talent show could not go unoticed, I was thoroughly entertained .
						Everyone
						got out of their comfort zone especially
						those who danced.

						The praise and worship was powerful...the Daniel and Joseph calling. ..
						was the
						objective of our camp...Learning how
						both men of God were able to exist in somewhat of a modern world and
						able to
						please God and stand up for the Lord in
						leadership positions. With challenges of being sold off by your own
						brothers...Or being thrown in the pit of lions.
						Their lives represent what we should all aspire to be in our walk with
						Christ as
						young people .

						Growth is a journey and It cannot happen over night . This trip was the
						beginning of something great installed in me .
						It provided us with a foundation to built from "</p>

					<p>In a nutshell, it was life transforming and mind renewing. . I prepared my
						mind and
						heart to digest a whole new
						perspective on the lives of Joseph and Daniel...Then came the teachings
						on
						Joseph and Daniel (from Wednesday to Thursday
						morning), but by now as far as I was concerned, it was 'Jesus or
						nothing'. The
						foundation had been laid for the rest of
						the camp, and everything made sense.</p>
